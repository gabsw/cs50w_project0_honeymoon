        Are you planning on getting married anytime soon and looking for the perfect romantic getaway?
    </h3>

    <div>
        <p>These days, when it comes to planning a wedding, the honeymoon that follows the big day has increasingly
            become
            just as important as the event itself.</p>
        <p>Getting hitched will always be the best excuse for you to take those holidays from work that you have been
            postponing and focus on splurging on your dream vacation, with no guilty conscience.</p>
        <p>However, the trip of your dreams won't magically materialize itself before your eyes: the planning stage will
            be
            crucial to put the odds in your favor so that your vision will come together.</p>
        <p>So many things can go wrong while traveling: missed flights and transfers that may leave you stranded in a
            strange place, hotel rooms that don't look anything like their promising pictures or even lousy weather that
            will keep you from enjoying your itinerary.</p>
        <p>In order to guide you and make sure that you will be getting the postcard honeymoon that you've been dreaming
            about, The Honeymoon Planner will help you select the ideal location, according to your specific tastes:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><a href="adventure.html">Adventure</a> if you are an adrenaline seeker.</li>
            <li><a href="culture.html">Culture</a> if you want to explore an historic city.</li>
            <li><a href="relaxation.html">Relaxation</a> if you want to lie on a paradisiac beach.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>For each destination, we present you valuable information on the best time of the year to visit,
            affordability
            for you to set up your budget, closest airport to monitor flights and a scale for LGBT-friendliness, to
            guarantee that you will always feel comfortable during your trip.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we have selected a compilation of the best online <a href="resources.html">travel resources</a>,
            so
            that you can set up everything you will need for this trip from reliable sources: flights, accommodation and
