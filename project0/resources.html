        <h4>Skyscanner</h4>
        <img src="img_resources/skyscanner.jpg" alt="Skyscanner logo">
        <p>Skyscanner is a metasearch engine that allows you to locate optimal flight routes. It has a fantastic feature called Flexflight, which grants you the possibility of searching flights by cheapest travel dates or destinations. If you are still in the brainstorming phase of planning, you can simply a budget for your airfare and see where Skyscanner takes you or play around with dates to discover when it will be more accessible to your wallet to go to that dream place that you have in mind.</p>
        <p>Hint: After getting the details of the flight of your choice, try to book it with the airline itself instead of third-party vendors, even if it is slightly more expensive. It may pay off in terms of customer support in case something that doesn’t go as planned.</p>

        <h4>Booking</h4>
        <img src="img_resources/booking.jpg" alt="Booking logo">
        <p>Booking is a metasearch engine for lodging reservations. You will be able to find rooms in all types of accommodations, ranging from 5-star luxury resorts to shared hostel rooms. The options are extremely diverse and you will certainly find something that will fit your needs. You can be very picky by setting up all kinds of filters, such as searching exclusively rooms that accommodate pets.</p>
        <p>Hint: Pay close attention to the Location ratings and descriptions. You may be convinced by a bargain, but there is a good possibility that the accommodation may be hard to reach to offset the price.</p>

        <li>
        <h4>AirBnb</h4>
        <img src="img_resources/airbnb.jpg" alt="AirBnb logo">
        <p>Similarly to Booking, AirBnb is another service that provides lodging reservations. However, its main draw is the ability to arrange paid homestays and tourism experiences. The host will offer its own property to rent for a determined period of time and you will be able to choose if you want to rent the whole place or only a room. For many travelers, this arrangement provides a more intimate experience, since you will be able to stay in non-touristy areas and schedule activities with locals.</p>
        <p>Hint: Message back and forward with a potential host to get to know the person before making a reservation and get a full picture of the accommodation and rules.</p>

        <li>
        <h4>Expedia</h4>
        <img src="img_resources/expedia.jpg" alt="Expedia logo">
        <p>Expedia is a metasearch engine that will provide you with the full package to set up your holiday, since it can be used to book airline tickets, hotel reservations, car rentals, cruises, tickets for events and all kinds of vacation packages. This is the ideal service if you don’t have all the time in the world to plan your honeymoon, due to its practicality. The "Bundle" feature will let you combine all the services that you need.</p>
        <p>Hint: Use the "Add-On" feature, even if you don’t have a hotel in mind by the time that you want to book your flight and rental. It will let you add an accommodation option until the depart day and you will unlock significant discounts.</p>
